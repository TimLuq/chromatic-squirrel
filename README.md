# Chromatic Squirrel
This project's goal is to be a working implementation of a SQRL client for use as an extension for Chromium based browsers.
Mainly this is to allow for the use of SQRL on every platform where Chome is available but where another client may be difficult to install, such as for Chrome OS.

There may be an option to use some other local backend for the password/decryption stages on systems that support it which may be harder for an attacker to reach than an browser extension.

# Current Status
Currently only the basic design elements are in place.
